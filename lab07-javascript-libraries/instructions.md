# Lab 7: JavaScript Libraries
*Due: Tuesday, October 30, 2018*

Your assignment is to alter your Lab 6 webpage and use a JavaScript Library (jQuery) to perform the "show/hide" function.

## Preparations

- [ ] Make a copy of your **nyc** folder, call it **nyc2**
- [ ] Go to www.jquery.com and download the "development jQuery 3.3.1" version of the library.  Copy it into a file named **jquery.js** and put it in the **nyc2** folder

- Open the file: **index.html** in a web browser *and* a code editor (like Sublime Text)

- [ ] Edit the `<button>` element you created last time.  Change the text to: `Show/Hide Data Table`
  - For simplicity, for this lab assignment, you're *not* going to toggle the text in the button.
- [ ] Install jQuery just below the closing `</div> <!-- close .container -->` line and directly above the `<script>` element that you wrote last time.
- [ ] Delete the JavaScript code *inside* the script element (all the JavaScript you wrote last time.)
  - Leave the opening and closing `<script>` tags there

## Requirements

### The Goal

- The goal is the same: when this page opens in a web browser, the data table should be hidden.  Then when the user clicks the button, the data table should appear.  When the user clicks the button again, it should disappear.
- This time, you'll use jQuery to perform the functions.
- This time, leave the button text alone.
- This time, have the data table appear and disappear "fast"

## Get credit

To get credit for this exercise, ZIP (compress) your **nyc2** folder and upload the ZIP file to the **Lab 7** assignment in Blackboard.
