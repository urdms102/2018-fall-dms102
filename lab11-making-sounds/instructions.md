# Lab 11: Making Sounds
*Due: Tuesday, November 20, 2018*

Your assignment is to follow along and alter the required programs presented in today's lecture.

## General Requirements

- [ ] All the following programs need to be written in a single file named: **lab11.py**

- [ ] For *each* program, the following is required:
  - Comment headings to identify and separate each program<br>example:

  ```python
  # *******************************************************
  # Program 121 (page 267) Generate a Sine Wave at a Given 
  #   Frequency and Amplitude
  # *******************************************************
  ```

- [ ] REMOVE all instances of play() in any program that uses it

- [ ] A block of `#TEST` code (commented-out) for each program that does the following:
	- loads appropriate sound file(s) if required
	- runs the program using all the required arguments
	- creates output, typically using the explore() function as needed

## Sine Waves

- [ ] Copy **Program 121 (p267): Generate a Sine Wave at a Given Frequency and Amplitude**

- [ ] Copy **Program 122: (p267): Add Two Sounds Together**

- [ ] For Program 122, write test code that generates two sounds that together create the greatest amplitude that can be made by combining two sine waves WITHOUT creating clipping

## Changing the frequency of a sound
- get a file like: **antidisestablishmenterianism.wav**
- remember to use `setMediaPath()` if needed to set the path to wherever you're working

- [ ] Copy **Program 116 (p261): Double the Frequency of a Sound**

- [ ] Make a new version (copy) of Program 116 (in comments: call it 116a)
  -	instead of double(), call the function triple()
  -	instead of double, triple the frequency
  -	make sure the length of the target is only as long as it needs to be

- [ ] Copy **Program 119 (p264): Shifting the Frequency of a Sound**
